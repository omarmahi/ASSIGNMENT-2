    What is artificial intelligence?</p>
</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    If you hear the term artificial intelligence (AI), you might think of <u>self-driving
    cars</u>, <u>robots</u>, <u>ChatGPT</u>, other AI chatbots, and artificially created images. But it's also important to look behind the outputs of AI and understand how the technology works and its impacts on this and future generations.

</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    AI is a concept that has been around formally since the 1950s when it was defined as a machine's ability to perform a task that would've previously required human intelligence. 
    This is quite a broad definition that has been modified over decades of research and technological advancements.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    When you consider assigning intelligence to a machine, such as a computer, it makes sense to start by defining the term 'intelligence' -- especially when you want to determine if an artificial system truly deserves it. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Our level of intelligence sets us apart from other living beings and is essential to the human experience. Some experts define intelligence as the ability to adapt, solve problems, plan, improvise in new situations, and learn new things. 
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    With intelligence sometimes seen as the foundation for being human, it's perhaps no surprise that we'd try and recreate it artificially in scientific endeavors. 
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Today's AI systems might demonstrate some traits of human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, perception, and even a limited spectrum of creativity and social intelligence.

            How can we use AI?

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    
    AI comes in different forms and has become widely available in everyday life. The smart speakers on your mantle with Alexa or Google voice assistant built-in are two great examples of AI. Other good examples include popular AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, the new Bing Chat, and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app"> Google Bard</a>. 
    When you ask ChatGPT for the capital of a country, or you ask Alexa to give you an update on the weather, the responses come from machine-learning algorithms.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Though these systems aren't a replacement for human intelligence or social interaction, they can use their training to adapt and learn new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly programmed to perform.

</p></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    ChatGPT is an AI chatbot capable of generating and translating natural language and answering questions. Though it's arguably the most popular AI tool, thanks to its widespread accessibility, OpenAI made significant waves in artificial intelligence by creating GPTs 1, 2, and 3 before releasing ChatGPT.GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, and GPT-3 was the largest language model at its 2020 launch, with 175 billion parameters. Then came GPT-3.5, which powers the free tier of ChatGPT. The largest version, GPT-4, accessible through ChatGPT Plus or Microsoft Copilot, has one trillion parameters.

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Though the safety of self-driving cars is a top concern of potential users, the technology continues to advance and improve with breakthroughs in AI. These vehicles use machine-learning algorithms to combine data from sensors and cameras to perceive their surroundings and determine the best course of action. Tesla's autopilot feature in its electric vehicles is probably what most people think of when considering self-driving cars. Still, Waymo, from Google's parent company, Alphabet, makes autonomous rides, like a taxi without a taxi driver, in San Francisco, CA, and Phoenix, AZ.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Cruise is another robotaxi service, and auto companies like Audi, GM, and Ford are also presumably working on self-driving vehicle technology.

    The achievements of Boston Dynamics stand out in the area of AI and robotics. Though we're still a long way away from creating AI at the level of technology seen in the movie Terminator, watching Boston Dyanmics' robots use AI to navigate and respond to different terrains is impressive.

        How will AI change the world?
    </h2>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Artificial intelligence can change how we work, our health, how we consume media and get to work, our privacy, and more. 

Consider the impact that certain AI systems can have on the world. People can ask a voice assistant on their phones to hail rides from autonomous cars to get them to work, where they can use AI tools to be more efficient than ever before.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Doctors and radiologists could make cancer diagnoses using fewer resources, spot genetic sequences related to diseases, and identify molecules that could lead to more effective medications, potentially saving countless lives.

Alternatively, it's worth considering the disruption that could result from having neural networks that can create realistic images, such as Dall-E 3, Midjourney, and Copilot, that can replicate someone's voice or create deepfake videos using a person's resemblance. These deepfakes could undermine the photos, videos, or audio people consider genuine.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    AI is having a huge impact on the 21<sup>st</sup>  century. It's in our phones, cars, and even hospitals, making things smarter and more efficient. While there are concerns about job losses and bias, AI also holds the promise of solving challenging problems and improving our lives in many ways.  The future of AI is bright, but we need to develop it responsibly.
